# CSS Calc() Errors
This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS. Specifically, it focuses on:

1. **Unit inconsistencies:** Mixing percentages and pixels without proper grouping can cause issues.
2. **Order of operations:**  `calc()` follows standard mathematical rules; forgetting parentheses may lead to wrong results.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.
