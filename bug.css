The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if the calculation itself is invalid. For example, `width: calc(100% + 10px);` is valid, but `width: calc(100% + 10%);` might cause issues.  Another problem is that `calc()` can be affected by the order of operations if the expressions aren't grouped correctly using parentheses.
